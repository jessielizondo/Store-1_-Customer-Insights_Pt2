# 🛒 Store 1 Advanced Customer Analysis  
Data analysis for targeted marketing using Python

## 📌 Introduction  
Store 1 is an e-commerce company continuing with the second phase of its customer analysis. This stage builds upon the foundations from Part 1 — data cleaning and exploration — to tackle more advanced challenges related to:

- Customer **age**  
- Their **purchase history**  
- The **product categories** they buy  

This project aims to uncover deeper, more complex insights that improve customer segmentation and enhance marketing campaign effectiveness.

## 🎯 Business Problem  
Customer behavior varies by age, interests, and habits. In this second phase, the goal is to deepen our understanding of these patterns in order to:

- Design more effective personalized campaigns  
- Identify high-value customers for loyalty strategies  

## 🔍 Objectives  
✔ Analyze complex behavioral patterns by age and category  
✔ Detect segments with high business value  
✔ Apply clustering or exploratory models if needed  
✔ Generate actionable insights for advanced marketing  

## ❓ Key Questions  
- What advanced purchasing patterns emerge by age or category?  
- Which segments deliver the greatest business value?  
- How have customer preferences evolved?  
- Can we group customers by behavioral similarity?  

## 📊 Key Metrics  

📌 **Customer Metrics**  
- Advanced distribution by age and frequency  
- Estimated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  
- Customer clustering by behavior  

📌 **Product Metrics**  
- Category preferences by demographic segment  
- Relationship between category and customer profile  

📌 **Expected Insights**  
- High-value, loyal customer segments  
- Deeper behavioral trends
